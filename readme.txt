Stella for webOS

Ported by Roland Schabenberger

--

The Atari 2600 Video Computer System (VCS), introduced in 1977,
was the most popular home video game system of the early 1980's.
Now you can enjoy all of your favorite Atari 2600 games on your
webOS device thanks to Stella!

Stella is a multi-platform Atari 2600 VCS emulator released under
the GNU General Public License (GPL). Stella was originally
developed for Linux by Bradford W. Mott, and is currently maintained
by Stephen Anthony. Since its original release several people have
joined the development team to port Stella to other operating systems
such as AcornOS, AmigaOS, DOS, FreeBSD, IRIX, Linux, OS/2, MacOS, Unix,
and Windows. The development team is working hard to perfect the
emulator and we hope you enjoy our effort.

On http://stella.sourceforge.net/ you'll find information about downloading, installing,
using, and enhancing Stella.  You'll also find useful information
about the Atari 2600, emulation and homebrew development.
